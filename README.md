# NTHU 2021 Logic Design Lab

## Lab0 - FPGA Tutorial and Board Test
- Going through the Vivado tutorial for FPGA implementation.
- Testing the Basys 3 FPGA board.

## Lab1 - Shifter
- Getting familiar with basic Verilog modeling styles.

## Lab2 - Counter and Traffic Light Controller
- Getting familiar with counter and FSM designs in Verilog.

## Lab3 - Clock Divider and LED Controller
- Getting familiar with the clock divider and LED control on the FPGA demo board.
- Practicing finite-state machines (FSMs) in Verilog.

## Lab4 - Counters
- Getting familiar with the 7-segment display and pushbuFons on the FPGA board.

  Note: Every signal connected to the pushbuFon (except the reset signal) should be properly processed with the debouncing and/or one-pulse converters.
- Getting familiar with the counter designs and finite-state machines in Verilog.

## Lab5 - The Fancy Ticket Machine
- Getting familiar with modeling finite state machines with Verilog.
- Getting familiar with the FPGA design flow and the demo board.

## Lab6 - Shuttle Bus
- Getting familiar with modeling finite state machines with Verilog.
- Getting familiar with the keyboard control on the FPGA board.

## Lab7 - Digital Photo Frame
- Getting familiar with finite state machines (FSMs) in Verilog.
- Getting familiar with the control of VGA display, keyboard and other I/Os on the FPGA demo board.

## Lab8 - Electric Piano
- Getting familiar with the audio peripheral and Pmod Connector.

## Lab9 - Self-Driving Car
- Getting familiar with Pmod connectors for external devices.
- Getting familiar with the 3-way track sensor and ultrasonic sensor.
- Learn how to control the motor with a typical motor driver using PWM signals.

## Final Project - Flappy Bird

### Design Concept
- User can use the space key to control the height of the bird, allowing the bird to pass through the water pipe continuously and avoiding the attacks of various monsters on the way. Finally, the bird return to its nest.
- If the bird dies on the way or clear the stage, you can use the backspace key to restart the game.
